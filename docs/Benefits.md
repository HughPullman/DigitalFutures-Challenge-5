# Benefits of the backend services

The backend services allow for our frontend application to create, read, update and delete from the database. Within this context it allows the user to save locations, get their saved locations and delete any no longer wanted locations.

### Problems it is solving

The main problem the backend service is solving is that the user cannot save their information and data easily. The backend service solves this by giving the user a chance to register and login with their information. It then allows them to save their preferences to be seen later when needed.

### Benefits to the user

This brings a number of benefits to the user by allowing them to save their details with a login/registration system and then giving them the chance to save information that they want. This allows them to easily see their saved locations and to keep track of potential locations they want.

### Impact on the business

This will allows the users business to keep track of a number of different locations that they have saved all within the same application. They could also have a number of different user logins to save locations for different uses. This can help the business by giving them a quick and easy space to search and then save locations when needed.
